General repository for short conceptual outlines of possible projects or collaborations

I am a language enthusiast that's also interested in the intersections of language and community. I work on evaluative language
and would ultimately want to know whether there's any reason "hondkoud" ('dog cold' in Afrikaans) is possible but not *katkoud*
('cat cold' in Afrikaans). It is also of interest to me to investigate taboos and the way they are incorporated in language. In my free time I'm into the study of philosophical ideas like our society having too much being the reason why everyone is so sick all the time.
