# Idees_vir_beter
General repository for short conceptual outlines of possible projects or collaborations

I am a language enthusiast that's also interested in the intersections of language and community. I work on evaluative language
and would ultimately want to know whether there's any reason "hondkoud" ('dog cold' in Afrikaans) is possible by not *katkoud*
('cat cold' in Afrikaans). I am also into the study of philosophical ideas like our society having too much being the reason
why everyone is so sick all the time.
